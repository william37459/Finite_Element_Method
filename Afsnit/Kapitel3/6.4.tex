    Let $t \geq 2$, and suppose $\mathcal{T}_h$ is a shape-regular triangulation of $\OO$. Then there exists a constant $c = c(\OO, \kappa, t)$ such that
    \begin{equation}
        \norm{u - I_h u}_{m,h} \leq c h^{t-m} \norm{u}_{t, H^t(\OO)}, \quad for u \in H^t(\OO), \quad 0 \leq m \leq t,
        \label{eq:6.5}
    \end{equation}
    where $I_h u$ denotes the interpolation by a piecewise polynomial of degreee $t-1$.\label{thm:6.4}
\end{thmx}

\begin{bev}
    It is enough to establish the following inequality
    \begin{equation}
        ||u-I_h u||_{m,T_j} \leq c h^{t-m} |u|_{t,T_j}, \quad for all u \in H^t(T_j)
    \end{equation}
    for every triangle $T_j$ of a shape-regular triangulation $\mathcal{T}_h$. By choosing a reference triangle with $\hat{r} = 2^{-1/2}$, $\hat{\rho} = {(2+\sqrt{2})}^{-1}$ and letting $F : T_{ref} \to T$ with $T = T_j \in \mathcal{T}_h$. We can apply *Lemma 6.2* on the reference triangle and using the transformations formula *ref* in both directions, we get
    \begin{align}
        ||u-I_h u||_{m,T_j} &\leq c ||B^{-1}||^m |\det B |^{1/2} |\hat{u} - I_h \hat{u}|_{m,T_{ref}} \\
                            &\leq c ||B^{-1}||^m |\det B |^{1/2} c | \hat{u} |_{t,T_{ref}} \\
                            &\leq c ||B^{-1}||^m |\det B |^{1/2} \cdot c ||B||^t \cdot |\det B |^{1/2} |u|_{t,T}  \\
                            &\leq c \left( ||B||  \cdot ||B^{-1}||^m \right) ||B||^{t-m} |u|_{t,T}
    \end{align}
    Furthermore, by shape regularity, $r / \rho \leq \kappa$, and $||B|| \cdot ||B^{-1}|| \leq \left( 2 + \sqrt{2} \right)\kappa$. Thus, we get that *ref* $||B|| \leq h/\hat{\rho}\leq 4h$. With all this we have
    \begin{equation}
        ||u-I_h u||_{\mathcal{l},T_j} \leq c h^{t-\mathcal{l}} |u|_{t,T}
    \end{equation}
    Lastly by squaring and summing the terms from $\mathcal{l}$ to $m$ we get the desired result.
