We have, so far, used the norms $|\cdot|$ and $\|\cdot\|$ defined over $\OO$. 
This becomes too restrictive, as in approximating the solution we examine a 
reference element. The norms will therefore change depending on the constructed 
mesh. We do so using the following definition.
\begin{defn}{\quad}
    Let $\mathcal{T}_h = \{ T_1,T_2,\ldots,T_M\}$ be a partition of $\OO$, and 
    let $m\geq 1$. Then define 
    \begin{equation*}
        \|v\|_{m,h} = \sqrt{\sum_{T_j\in \mathcal{T}_h}\|v\|^2_{m,T_j}}
    \end{equation*}
\end{defn}
We note if $v\in H^m(\OO)$ then $\|v\|_{m,h}=\|v\|_{m,\OO}$.
