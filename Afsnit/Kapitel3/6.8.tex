    Let $(S_h)$ be an affine family of finite elements consisting of piecewise polynmoials of degreee k associated with uniform partitions. Then there exists a constant $c = c(\kappa, k, t)$ such that for all $0 \leq m \leq t$,
    \begin{equation}
        {\|v_h\|}_{t,h} \leq ch^{m-t}\|v_h\|_{m,h} for v \in \Pi_{ref}
    \end{equation}
