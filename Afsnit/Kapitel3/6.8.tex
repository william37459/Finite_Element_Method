\begin{thmx}[Inverse Estimates]
    Let $(S_h)$ be an affine family of finite elements consisting of piecewise polynmoials of degreee k associated with uniform partitions. Then there exists a constant $c = c(\kappa, k, t)$ such that for all $0 \leq m \leq t$,
    \begin{equation}
        {\|v_h\|}_{t,h} \leq ch^{m-t}\|v_h\|_{m,h} for v \in \Pi_{ref}
    \end{equation}
\end{thmx}

\begin{bev}
    By the Transformation Formula~\ref{thm:transformation} we can reduce the proof to only consider the reference element. Since all norms on finite dimensional vector spaces are equivalent it suffices to show
    \begin{equation}
        |v|_{t,T_{ref}} \leq c |v|_{m, T_{ref}} \quad \forall v \in \Pi_{ref}
    \end{equation}
    with $c = c(\Pi_{ref})$. To obtain the inequality we consider the vector space $\Pi_{ref}\oplus \mathcal{P}_{m-1}$. Let $Iv \in \mathcal{P}_{m-1}$ be a polynomial that interpolates $v$ at fixed points. $|Iv|_t = 0$, since $t > m-1$ and the Bramble-Hilbert lemma we get
    \begin{align}
        |v|_t &= |v-Iv|_t \leq ||v-Iv||_t \\
              &\leq c||v-Iv||_m 
              &\leq c|v|_m\label{eq:bramble-hilbert-1}
    \end{align}
    where~\eqref{eq:bramble-hilbert-1} follows from the Bramble-Hilbert lemma with $L=1-I$. To extend to elements of size $h$, the same procedure as~\ref{thm:6.4} should be applied. This results in the factor $ch^{m-t}$ in the estimate. Lastly by summing the square of the expressions over all triangles or quadrilaterials leads to the desired result.
