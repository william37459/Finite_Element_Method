\begin{thmx}{Transformation Formula\label{thm:transformation}}
    Let $\OO$ and $\tilde{\OO}$ be affine equivalents; meaning 
    there exists some square, nonsingular matrix $B$, such that 
    \begin{align*}
        F:&\tilde{\OO}\to \OO, \\
        & F(\tilde{x}) = x_0 + B\tilde{x},
    \end{align*}
    which is affine and bijective. For $v\in H^m(\OO)$ define 
    $\tilde{v}(\tilde{x}) = v(F(\tilde{x}))$.
    Then there exists some $c$ such that 
    \begin{equation*}
        |\tilde{v}|_{m,\tilde{\OO}} \leq 
        c \frac{\|B\|^m }{\sqrt{|\det(B)|}}|v|_{m,\OO}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{thmx}
Here $\|B\|$ is the operator norm, and in our case can be thought of 
as 
\begin{equation*}
    \|B\| = \sup\{ \| By\| :\|y\| = 1 \land y \in \tilde{\OO} \}.
\end{equation*}
If $B$ had another domain than $\tilde{\OO}$, that domain would simply 
replace $\tilde{\OO}$ in the definition.
\begin{bev}
   Writing the $m$th derivative as a multilinear form, we get 
   \begin{equation*}
    (D^m\tilde{v}(\tilde{x}))(\tilde{y}_1, \tilde{y}_2, )
   \end{equation*}
