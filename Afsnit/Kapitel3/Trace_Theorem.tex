\begin{defn}{Trace Theorem}\label{defn:trace}
    Let $\Omega$ be a bounded, and suppose $\Omega$ has a piecewise smooth boundary. In addition, suppose $\omega$ satisfies the cone condition. Then there exists a bounded linear mapping
    \begin{equation*}
        \gamma : H^1(\Omega) \to L_2(\Gamma)
    \end{equation*}
\end{defn}
\begin{bev}
    The presented proof will only be done in two dimensions, but can be generalised to higher dimensions.
    Suppose the boundary is piecewise smooth, and for the finitely many points where the boundary is not smooth the cone condition is satisfied. We can split the boundary into a finite number of smooth pieces $\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2, \dots, \Gamma_m$, where each $\Gamma_i$ after rotation of the coordinate system gives us

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For some function $\phi = \phi_i \in C^1[y_1, y_2]$, we have
            \[ \Gamma_i = \{ (x,y) \in \RR^2 \quad | \quad x = \phi(y), y_1 \leq y \leq y_2 \}. \]
        \item The domain $\Omega_i = \{ (x,y) \subset \RR^2 \quad | \quad \phi(y) + r, y_1 < y < y_n \}$ is contained in $\Omega$, where $r > 0$
    \end{enumerate}
