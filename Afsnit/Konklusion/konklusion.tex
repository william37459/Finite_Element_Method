\section{Conclusion}
We have examined how the space containing the function for a partial differential equations is defined, furthermore we have seen how the space can be split up to smaller sections.
This can be one using either squares (quadrilaterals) or triangles (triangulation), where each of the two methods have their own advantages and disadvantages.
After splitting up the space we are able to use the Finite Element Method to approximate numeric solutions and calculate the error of the approximation as seen in the application section.
