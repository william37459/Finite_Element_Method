\chapter{Conclusion}
We have examined how the space containing the solution to a PDE 
with boundary conditions can be constructed, and how a solution can be 
approximated using piecewise polynomials, and by partitioning the domain 
into smaller pieces.
We have focused mostly on partitioning using triangles, though rectangles could 
also have been chosen.
After partitioning the domain we are able to use the Finite Element Method to approximate numerical solutions, 
as we've done in the application section of this project, to 
varying degrees of success, with some behaviour in the convergence rate which were 
not explained.
