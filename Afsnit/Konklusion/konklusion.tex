\chapter{Conclusion}
We have examined how the space containing the solution to a differential equation 
with boundary conditions can be constructed, and how a solution can be 
approximated using piecewise polynomials, and by partitioning the domain 
into smaller pieces.
We have focused mostly on partitioning using triangles, though squares could 
also have been chosen.
After splitting up the domain we are able to use the Finite Element Method to approximate numeric solutions, 
as we've done in the application section of this paper.
