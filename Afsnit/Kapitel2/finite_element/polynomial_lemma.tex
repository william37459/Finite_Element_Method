\begin{remark}{\quad\label{rmk:invariant_polynomials}}
   Let $f\in\mathcal{P}_t$ and $V$ an affine linear transformation. 
   Expressing $f\circ V$ in the appropiate coordinates, we find 
   $f\circ V\in\mathcal{P}_t$. Shifting polynomials every which way 
   still results in polynomials. The set $\mathcal{P}_t$ is 
   therefore invariant under affine linear transformations.
\end{remark}
Remark~\ref{rmk:invariant_polynomials} shows that using polynomials 
as shape functions in a finite reference element is possible.
