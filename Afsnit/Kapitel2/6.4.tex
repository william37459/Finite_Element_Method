    Let $t \geq 2$, and suppose $\mathcal{T}_h$ is a shape-regular triangulation of $\OO$. Then there exists a constant $c = c(\OO, \kappa, t)$ such that
    \begin{equation}
        \norm{u - I_h u}_{m,h} \leq c h^{t-m} \norm{u}_{t, H^t(\OO)}, \quad for u \in H^t(\OO), \quad 0 \leq m \leq t,
    \end{equation}
    where $I_h u$ denotes the interpolation by a piecewise polynomial of degreee $t-1$.

\begin{bev}
    It is enough to establish the following inequality
    \begin{equation}
        ||u-I_h u||_{m,T_j} \leq c h^{t-m} |u|_{t,T_j}, \quad for all u \in H^t(T_j)
    \end{equation}
    for every triangle $T_j$ of a shape-regular triangulation $\mathcal{T}_h$. By choosing a reference triangle with $\hat{r} = 2^{-1/2}$, $\hat{\rho} = {(2+\sqrt{2})}^{-1}$ and letting $F : T_{ref} \to T$ with $T = T_j \in \mathcal{T}_h$. We can apply *Lemma 6.2* on the reference triangle and using the transformations formula *ref* in both directions, we get
