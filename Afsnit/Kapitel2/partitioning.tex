\section{Partitioning}
Partitioning some domain simply means splitting it into a number of subsdomains. 
There are different ways to do that and different desirable qualities. 
The important one will be covered later.

By partitioning $\OO$, we also create a new space of functions over $\OO$. 
By splicing the function over each cell, we can create all kinds of 
discontinuous functions
; this, however, does not help us reach our goal, 
as many of these functions are not necessarily differentiable. 
For each cell, we create certain requirements on the edges for the functions 
over this cell. The functions which obey these requirements make up $S_h$.

We now move from discussing $\OO$, to what a finite element is,
and how to construct them.
