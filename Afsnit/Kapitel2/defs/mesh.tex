\begin{defn}{Admissible Partition}
   A partition of $\OO$ into triangles or quadrilaterals, using 
   $\mathcal{T} = \{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_M \}$, is called admissible if:
   \label{def:admissible_partition}
   \begin{enumerate}
    \item $ \bar{\OO} = \cup_{i=1}^M T_i$
    \item If $T_i \cap T_j$ is exactly one point, it is a common vertex of 
    $T_i$ and $T_j$
    \item If, for $i\neq j$, $T_i \cap T_j$ is more than one point, it is a 
    common edge of $T_i$ and $T_j$.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
We further describe these partitions. If every element in $\mathcal{T}$ has points 
which have at most a distance of $2h$, or equivalently a diameter of $2h$, 
we write $\mathcal{T}_h$. %TODO Family of partitions?
