\section{Variational Problems and Solutions}
The goal of this section is to start developing the mathematical 
precision to know of the existence of solutions to a PDE, and find 
them. 
To do this, we start with a general abstract theorem on how solutions 
behave in certain problems, then we look at a connection between 
classical solutions and solutions of variational problems, then a 
theorem regarding uniqueness of solutions, and then existence of 
weak solutions.
