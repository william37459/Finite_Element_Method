\section{Variational Problems and Solutions}
The goal of this section is to start developing the mathematical 
precision to know of the existence of solutions to a PDE, and find 
them. 
To do this, we start with a general abstract theorem on how solutions 
behave in certain problems, then we look at a connection between 
classical solutions and solutions of variational problems, then a 
theorem regarding uniqueness of solutions, and then existence of 
weak solutions.

Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem} does not guarantee the existence 
of solutions, only their shape. In Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem} we 
also only make assumptions on the linearity of the space. 
It is possible to setup a variational problem such that $J$ does 
not obtain its minimum.
To engage with the existence of solutions, we make more assumptions on 
the space in which we work. To do this we work with Hilbert spaces. 
We start by specifying the bilinear form in Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem} 
a bit.
\begin{defn}{\quad}
   Let $H$ be a Hilbert space. A bilinear form $a : H \times H \mapsto \RR$ is 
   called continuous if there exists some $C > 0$ such that 
   \begin{equation}
    |a(u,v)| \leq C \|u\|\, \|v\| \quad \forall u,v \in H.
    \label{eq:testte}
   \end{equation} 
   If the bilinear form $a$ is symmetric and continuous, it is called 
   elliptic if there exists som $\alpha >0$ such that 
   \begin{equation*}
    a(v,v) \geq \alpha \|v\|^2 \quad \forall v \in H.
   \end{equation*}
\end{defn}
We now use Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem} to show a link between classical 
solutions and solutions of appropriate variational problems.
\input{Afsnit/Kapitel1/sætninger/Minimal_Property.tex}
The same kind of proof can be used to show, that a solution $u$ to 
(\ref{eq:min_prop_variational_problem}) which fulfills 
$u\in C^2(\OO) \cap C^0(\OO)$ is also a classical solution. 
This gives a connection between classical solutions and solutions of 
variational problems. We now proceed to examine the existence of a 
solution.
