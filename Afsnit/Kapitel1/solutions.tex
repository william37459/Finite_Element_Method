\section{Variational Problems and Solutions}
The goal of this section is to start developing the mathematical 
precision to know of the existence of solutions to a PDE, and how to find 
them. 
To do this, we start with a general abstract theorem on how solutions 
behave in certain problems, then we look at a connection between 
classical solutions and solutions of variational problems, a 
theorem regarding uniqueness of solutions, and existence of 
weak solutions.

Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem} does not guarantee the existence 
of solutions, it only characterizes them. In Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem} we 
also only make assumptions on the linearity of the space. 
It is possible to set up a variational problem such that $J$ does 
not attain its minimum.
To engage with the existence of solutions, we make more assumptions on 
the space in which we work. To do this we work with Hilbert spaces. 
We start by specifying the bilinear form in Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem}.
\begin{defn}{\quad}
   Let $H$ be a Hilbert space. A bilinear form $a : H \times H \to \RR$ is 
   called continuous if there exists some $C > 0$ such that 
   \begin{equation}
    |a(u,v)| \leq C \|u\|\, \|v\| \quad \forall u,v \in H.
   \end{equation} 
   If a bilinear form $a$ is symmetric and continuous, and there exists som $\alpha >0$ such that 
   \begin{equation*}\label{eq:elliptic}
    a(v,v) \geq \alpha \|v\|^2 \quad \forall v \in H,
   \end{equation*}
   $a$ is called elliptic.
 \end{defn}
We now use Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem} to show a link between classical 
solutions and solutions of appropriate variational problems.
\input{Afsnit/Kapitel1/sætninger/Minimal_Property.tex}
The same kind of proof can be used to show that a solution $u$ to 
(\ref{eq:min_prop_variational_problem}) which fulfills 
$u\in C^2(\OO) \cap C^0(\OO)$ is also a classical solution. 
This gives a connection between classical solutions and solutions of 
variational problems. We now proceed to examine the existence of a 
solution.
\input{Afsnit/Kapitel1/sætninger/Lax_Milgram_Thm.tex}
The Hilbert spaces we are going to be working with are all going to be 
vector spaces, and thus convex by definition. 
We can therefore use Theorem \ref{thm:lax_milgram} without further considerations 
on our spaces.
\input{Afsnit/Kapitel1/sætninger/Lax_Milgram_Cor.tex}

After proving these statements on qualities of a solution, we can now move 
on to discussing the existence of these solutions. We start by looking at 
sufficiently well-defined solutions.

\begin{defn}{\quad}
    The Dirichlet problem with homogeneous boundary conditions,
     (\ref{eq:b_v_problem_homogeneous}), has a weak solution $u\in H_0^1(\OO)$
     if 
     \begin{equation*}
        a(u,v) = (\tilde{f},v)_0 \quad \forall v \in H_0^1(\OO).
     \end{equation*}
     Here $a(u,v)$ is the bilinear from from Equation (\ref{eq:a(u,v)}), 
     and $(\tilde{f},v)_0$ is a linear bounded functional provided $\tilde{f}\in L^2$, and it can therefore be used as $\ell(v)$ in equation (\ref{eq:l(v)}).
\end{defn}


\input{Afsnit/Kapitel1/sætninger/existence_theorem.tex}


We can use Theorem \ref{thm:existence_hom_dirichlet} to examine the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem, 
see (\ref{eq:b_v_problem}). From (\ref{eq:b_v_problem_homogeneous}), let 
$\tilde{u} \in C^2(\OO)\cap C^0(\bar{\OO}) \cap H^1(\OO)$ be a function such that 
\begin{equation*}
   \tilde{u} = g \quad \text{on } \partial \OO.
\end{equation*}
To find a weak solution $w \in H_0^1(\OO)$, we use Theorem \ref{thm:existence_hom_dirichlet} and the 
fact that $(L\tilde{u},v) = a(\tilde{u},v)$, to solve (\ref{eq:b_v_problem}), and
we find $u \in H^1(\OO)$ such that 
\begin{align*}
   a(u,v) = (f,v)_0 \quad \forall v &\in H_0^1(\OO) \\
   u-\tilde{u} & \in H_0^1(\OO).
\end{align*}
