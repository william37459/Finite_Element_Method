\begin{defn}{Cone Condition}~\label{def:cone_condition}
    Let $E$ be a Euclidean space and let $G$ be an open subset of $E$. Then the cone condition is satisfied at $x$ if for all $x\in G$ there exists some cone $V_{e(x),h}$ such that $x+V_{e(x),h}\subset G$.
    Where $e(x)$ is the axis vector and $h$ is the height.
