\section{Boundary Value or Variational Problems}
When working with ODE's, both problems with boundary conditions 
and initial value conditions can be solved. When working with 
PDE's that is no longer the case. The different types 
of PDE's demand differently posed problems. 

The theory of FEM springs from elliptic PDE's, so we will start 
describing these problems for elliptic PDE's. Since we are working with 
elliptic PDE's, we write
\begin{align*}
    Lu &= f \quad \text{in } \Omega \\
    u &= 0 \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega,
\end{align*}
which have what is called homogeneous boundary conditions. Of course, 
if $u=c$ on $\partial \Omega$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$.
