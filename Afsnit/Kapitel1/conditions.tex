The theory of FEM stems from elliptic PDE's, so we will start by
describing these problems for elliptic PDE's.
\begin{defn}{Partial Differential Operator}~\label{def:pde_operator}
    Let $L$ denote the Partial Differential Operator defined as
    \begin{equation}
        Lu = - \sum_{i,k=1}^n \partial_i(a_{ik} \partial_k u)+ a_0u.
    \end{equation}
    Where $a_{ik}$ are entries in a matrix denoted $A(x)$.
\end{defn}
The ellipticity requirement in Definition~\ref{def:pde_classification} only 
makes demands on the coefficients for the second order partial derivatives, 
and we will ignore the other parts for now. Unless otherwise stated, $L$ is 
always defined as in Definition~\ref{def:pde_operator}.
