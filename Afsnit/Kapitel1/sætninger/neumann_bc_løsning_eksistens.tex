   Let $\OO$  be bounded, have a piecewise smooth boundary, and satisfy the 
   cone condition. Let $f \in L_2( \OO)$ and $g\in L_2(\partial \OO)$.
   There exists a unique $u \in H^1(\OO)$ that solves the variational problem 
   \begin{equation*}
    J(v) = \frac{1}{2}a(v,v) - (f,v)_{0,\OO} - (g,v)_{0,\partial\OO} \to \min.
   \end{equation*}
   Also, $u \in C^2(\OO)\cap C^1(\bar{\OO})$ if and only if a classical solution 
   of 
   \begin{align}
    Lu &= f \quad \text{ in }\OO, \nonumber \\
    \sum_{i,k}  \vec{n}_i a_{ik} \partial_k u &= g \quad \text{ on } \partial \OO, \label{eq:neuman_condition_boundary}
   \end{align}
   exists, in which case these $2$ solutions are the same. Here $\vec{n}$ is outward 
   pointing normal on $\partial \OO$, defined almost everywhere.

   Obviously $ (f,v)_{0,\OO} - (g,v)_{0,\partial\OO}$ is a linear functional, 
   and since $a$ is $H^1$ elliptic, Theorem \ref{thm:lax_milgram} gives us the 
   uniqueness and existence of $u$.
   Corollary \ref{cor:lax_milgram} gives us
   \begin{equation}
      a(u,v) = (f,v)_{0,\OO} - (g,v)_{0,\partial\OO} \quad \forall v \in H^1(\OO). \label{eq:neumann_lax}
   \end{equation}
   We therefore now move on to the "if and only if" part of the theorem. Start by 
   assuming $u \in C^2(\OO)\cap C^1(\bar{\OO})$.
   If we look in the interior, and as such at $v \in H^1_0(\OO)$, we get $\gamma v=0$ 
   and Equation (\ref{eq:neumann_lax}) simply becomes a a Dirichlet problem where 
   $u$ is used to define the boundary condition, see HERE*. %TODO REFERENCE
   On the interior we then have 
   \begin{equation}
    Lu = f \quad \text{ in }\OO, \label{eq:neumann_on_interior}
   \end{equation} 
   which is the first condition in (\ref{eq:neuman_condition_boundary}).
   We now examine the boundary, and we assume $v\in H^1(\OO)$.
   In the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:minimal_property}, we used Green's formula,
    \begin{equation} %? Skal dette slettes?
        \int_\Omega v\partial_i w dx = -\int_\Omega w \partial_i v dx + \int_{\partial \Omega} v w \vec{n}_i ds.
    \end{equation}
   In that proof we could assume the integral on the boundary to be zero, which 
   we cannot do here. However, with the same arguments regarding summing and substituting, 
   we get that 
   \begin{equation}
      a(v,v) - (f,v)_{0,\OO} - (g,v)_{0,\partial\OO} = 
      \int_\OO v[Lu - f] dx + \int_{\partial \OO}
     [ \sum_{i,k}  \vec{n}_i a_{ik} \partial_k u-g]v ds.
     \label{eq:existence_neumann_last_eq}
   \end{equation}
   Using Equation (\ref{eq:neumann_lax}) and Equation (\ref{eq:neumann_on_interior}),
   the last integral in Equation (\ref{eq:existence_neumann_last_eq}) must be $0$.

   Suppose that for some $i$ and $k$ the function $v_0 = \vec{n}_i a_{ik} \partial_k u -g$ does 
   not vanish. Then $\int_{\partial\OO}v_0^2ds>0$, and by the density of 
   $C^1(\bar{\OO})$ in $C^0(\bar{\OO})$, there exists a $v\in C^1(\bar{\OO})$
   such that  $\int_{\partial\OO}v_0\cdot vds>0$, which cannot happen, due that 
   what we found out using Equation (\ref{eq:existence_neumann_last_eq}). 
   We therefore have the second condition in (\ref{eq:neuman_condition_boundary}),
   and $u$ is a classical solution of this boundary problem.

   On the other hand, assuming $u$ is a classical solution and satisfy (\ref{eq:neuman_condition_boundary}),
   we see from Equation (\ref{eq:existence_neumann_last_eq}) that $u$ also satisfy 
   Equation (\ref{eq:neumann_lax}), and is therefore and solution to the variational 
   problem, and by Theorem \ref{thm:lax_milgram} unique.
