The following corollary can be used to unify our approach.
\begin{kor}{\quad}
   Assume the same as in Theorem~\ref{thm:lax_milgram}, except $V=H$. Then 
   the solution $u$ is given by~\label{cor:lax_milgram}
   \begin{equation*}
    a(u,v) = \ell(v) \quad \forall v \in H.
   \end{equation*}

\begin{bev}
    The proof follows closely the proof for Theorem~\ref{thm:lax_milgram}. 
    Simply replace $V$ with $H$, to find the existence and uniqueness of the 
    solution, and use Theorem~\ref{thm:charac_theorem} to find the form, as 
    shown in the corollary.
\end{bev}
Theorem \ref{thm:minimal_property}, Theorem~\ref{thm:lax_milgram} and Corollary 
\ref{cor:lax_milgram} together shows us that solving a Dirichlet problem is 
the same as finding the minimum of the corresponding variational problem. 
We can use this in our approach both theoretically and computationally.
