We start on line 10 by defining our solution $u$ as the function from Equation \eqref{eq:app_dirichlet}.
After which we define two different interpolations of $u$ using the packages "numpy" and "ufl". 
Next, we need to define the mesh and the functions space, we will be working in. 
We do this on line 16-22, where $n$ defines the number of cells in each directions of our mesh, thus we get $n^2$ elements in total.
Then "degree" defines the degree polynomial we use to interpolate our functions.
Next step in the process is to define the trial and test functions on the domain $V$, which we do on line 24-26.
