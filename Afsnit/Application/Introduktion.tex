We will in this chapter apply the theory developed throughout the project to a specific example. 
Here we will consider the following problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
We wish to study convergence rate 
\begin{equation}
    u = \e^{x+y}\cos(x)\sin(y)+x  \quad\text{on }\Omega \label{eq:app_dirichlet}
\end{equation}



\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    Lu &= f \quad \text{in } \Omega \\
    u &= g \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega,
\end{split}
\end{align}
Note in this example that, for simplicity, we have chosen the solution $u$ to be the same on the boundary as in the domain.
We will use the finite element method to approximate a solution for the problem. In this context we use the framework FEniCS,
which is a computational tool for solving partial differential equations.
