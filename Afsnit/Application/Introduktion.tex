We will in this chapter apply the theory developed throughout the project to a specific example. 
Here we will consider the following problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    u &= \e^{x+y}\cos(x)\sin(y)+x && \quad\text{for }u\in\Omega \\
    u &= \e^{x+y}\cos(x)\sin(y)+x && \quad \text{for } u\in\partial\Omega\\
    f &= -\nabla u\quad && \quad 
\end{alignat*}
Note in this example that, for simplicity, we have chosen the solution $u$ to be the same on the boundary as in the domain.
We will use the finite element method to approximate a solution for the problem. In this context we use the framework FEniCS,
which is a computational tool for solving partial differential equations.
